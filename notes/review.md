# Content Review

Breakdown of over-arching features of either guides or codebases/libraries listed in the main README.md.

*Note(Ed):*
These notes were made to get a fundamental understanding of how to roll my own sophisticated imgui that could support, text, animations and layouts with different styles. Specifically for my use case, having an advanced layout system is critical. How I review the content will most likely show some bias toward this endeavor.
